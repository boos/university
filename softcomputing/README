requirements: 
* roto translation object to manipulate position of camera 
  * every rototranslation object need to have as input: 
    in: actual position x,y,z
    in: rotation degre value on axes x,y,z plus explicited error on x,y,z
    in: translation degre value on axes x,y,z plus explicited error on x,y,z
    out:  as output we have the new position 

ant colony optimization algorithms to optimize errors
csv parser to data in/out
